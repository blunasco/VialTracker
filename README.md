This Excel macro automates the process of tracking vials in the laboratory. It helps manage vial data by subtracting from the initial count of vials gathered during the creation of extraction standards.

The macro tracks the number of vials used by checking the number of files in the source folder, assuming each file corresponds to a set of vials used. The macro then automatically updates the remaining vial count each time the Excel file is opened, ensuring the user has the most up-to-date information.

The macroâ€™s interface provides an easy-to-read dashboard displaying:

Initial Vial Count: Set during the extraction standard creation process.

Remaining Vials: Automatically updated based on the number of files in the source folder.

File Tracking: Shows the number of files detected in the folder source.

Alerts: Notifications if vial counts fall below a certain threshold.
